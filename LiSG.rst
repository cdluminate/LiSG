Introduction
============

Different from commercial operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, the free
and open-source Linux operating system does not have any united official user
guide. Built upon the Linux kernel, different Linux distributions have very
distinct styles and mechanisms for assembling free and open-source software
from various sources, which eventually lead to fragmented pieces of knowledge
scattered across everywhere. Besides, the Linux world is also quickly evolving
with new tools and technologies, introducing yet more knowledge fragments.

In order to become an advanced user, one has to catch the invariance of Linux
during its evolving process, as well as build up a Linux knowledge network.
Thus, this document will try to interpret such "invariance" and "Linux
knowledge network" instead of duplicating materials you can see from other
Linux books.

This document mainly consists of three parts: (1) fundamental skills; (2)
having some fun with Linux; (3) Linux distribution development.

The author appreciates the UNIX philosophy and free software (following GNU's
definition).  The author wishes that this document can help the reader
understand some details of Linux and have fun with it, instead of struggling
under Linux.
